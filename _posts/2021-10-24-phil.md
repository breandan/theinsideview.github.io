title: "Phil Trammell on Economic Growth under Transformative AI"
category: Economics
---

Phil Trammell is an Oxford PhD student in economics and research associate at the Global Priorities Institute. Phil is one of the smartest person I know, when considering the intersection of the long-term future and economic growth. Funnily enough, Phil was my roomate, a few years ago in Oxford, and last time I called him he casually said that he had written an extensive report on the econ of AI. A few weeks ago, I decided that I would read that report (which actually is a literature review), and that I would translate everything that I learn along the way to diagrams, so you too can learn whatâ€™s inside that paper. The video covers everything from MacroEconomics 101 to self-improving AI in about 30-ish diagrams.
