title: "Connor Leahy on GPT3, EleutherAI and AI Alignment"
category: AI Alignment
---

In the first part of the podcast we chat about how to speed up GPT-3 training, how Conor updated on recent announcements of large language models, why GPT-3 is AGI for some specific definitions of AGI [1], the obstacles in plugging planning to GPT-N and why the brain might approximate something like backprop. We end this first chat with solomonoff priors [2], adversarial attacks such as Pascal Mugging [3], and whether direct work on AI Alignment is currently tractable. In the second part, we chat about his current projects at EleutherAI [4][5], multipolar scenarios and reasons to work on technical AI Alignment research.
