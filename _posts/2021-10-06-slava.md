In this episode I discuss Brain Computer Interfaces with Slava Bobrov, a self-taught Machine Learning Engineer applying AI to neural biosignals to control robotic limbs. This episode will be of special interest to you if you're an engineer who wants to get started with brain computer interfaces, or just broadly interested in how this technology could enhance human intelligence. Fun fact: most of the questions I asked were sent by my Twitter followers, or come from a Discord I co-created on Brain Computer Interfaces. So if you want your questions to be on the next video or you're genuinely interested in this topic, you can find links for both my Twitter and our BCI discord in the description.
