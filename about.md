Hi there. I'm Michaël Trazzi, your host for The Inside View podcast, and here's the first definition for what's an "inside view" on google:

> "Whereas the inside view attempts to make predictions based on an understanding of the details of a problem, the outside view—also called reference class forecasting—instead looks at similar past situations and predicts based on those outcomes."

Essentially, the goal of the podcast is to talk to people who have some [gears-level understanding](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/gears-level) about something that might be relevant to the [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

For such an event, we don't have any other examples to do some reference class forecasting, so any outside view reasoning would be difficult.

On top of that, it's usually frown upon to discuss Artificial General Intelligence timelines in academia or in the AI industry, so I wanted to create a place where people could casually chat about those things without having to censor themselves.

I occasionally make nice visuals that go together with the audio. See for instance the [episode with Phil Trammell](https://theinsideview.github.io/phil) on the econ of Transformative AI, or [the one with Charlie Snell](https://theinsideview.github.io/charlie) on AI Art.

If you just want to watch the popular ones, you could start with the episode with [Connor Leahy on EleutherAI and GPT-3](https://theinsideview.github.io/connor), or with [Slava Bobrov on Brain-Computer Interfaces](https://theinsideview.github.io/slava).
