Hi there. I'm [Michaël Trazzi](https://michaeltrazzi.com), your host for The Inside View podcast, and here's the first definition for what's an "inside view" on google:

> "Whereas the inside view attempts to make predictions based on an understanding of the details of a problem, the outside view—also called reference class forecasting—instead looks at similar past situations and predicts based on those outcomes."

The goal of this podcast is to create a place where people discuss their inside views about Artificial Intelligence progress without having to censor themselves. I started these interviews because I was having interesting conversations online and I thought it made sense to record them.

You should start with the popular episodes, namely [Connor Leahy](https://theinsideview.ai/connor2), [Ethan Caballero](https://theinsideview.ai/ethan) and [Robert Miles](https://theinsideview.ai/rob).
